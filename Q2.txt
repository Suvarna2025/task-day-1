What is objects and internal representation in javascript.

Objects are like containers in which it has unique attributes and behaviours.
For example: Brush, Pen, Computer, Car, Box etc

If we take Pen, It has many properties or attributes like color, brand, ink color, material, writing instrument 
form.

We can declare and define a object as 

Example:
var pen = {color: "pink", brand: "Hauser", ink-color: "Blue", material: "Plastic", writing-instrument 
form: "Ball point pen"}

In above example
color, brand, ink color, material, writing instrument form are property name and Pink, Hauser, Blue, Plastic
Ball point are the property value.

We can access object property as

Eg:
pen.color
